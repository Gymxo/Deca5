# Deca5 v1.2 Beta ‚òï

Tethered Downgrade Your A5 Device Today. By @zzanehip.

## What is Deca5?
* Deca5 (pronounced "Decaf") is a GUI tool to downgrade and jailbreak your A5 device. It is built with three things in mind: user-experience, performance, and reliability üëç.
* Deca5 is unique, it is built entierly using Swift, SwiftUI, and C ‚Äî it is built for modern versions of Mac OS. Moreover, much attention was given to the tool's design, look, and feel.
* And of course, Deca5 fully opensource üìÇ. Feel free to modify the tool to your liking. 
* Deca5 will run on any Mac running between El Capitan (**10.11**) and Big Sur (**11.0**) üñ•Ô∏è. It supports all **A5** (and theoretically all A6) devicesüì±.
* Users running **Catalina** or **Big Sur** can download Deca5. Users running between **El Capitan** and **Mojave** can download Deca5 "older Macs" build. 
* To use Deca5 you must enter pwndfu (not kDFU) - this is possible thanks to @a1exdandy, @nyansatan, and @synackuk https://github.com/synackuk/checkm8-a5
* **iOS 5, 6, and 7** can currently be jailbroken with Deca5 üéâ. Throughout the week I'll continue to add support for more versions (iOS 4, 8, and 9). While I've gotten every version to work, iOS 4, 8, and 9 are still far too unstable for release. 
* ***The latest release of Deca5 can be downloaded from [here.](https://github.com/zzanehip/Deca5/releases/latest)***  

 
## Using Deca5


The homescreen of Deca5 looks like this. You have options to Restore, Boot, and Jailbreak. 
![ss1](photos/ss1.png) 
To restore, first press "Select IPSW" and select your IPSW. Once you see the message "Done. You can restore" you can plug in your PWNED device and press "Restore Device." You'll know if you restored successfully if you see the message "Successfully restored device."

To boot, just plug in your PWNED device and press "Boot Device." You'll know if you booted successfully if you see the message "Successfully booted device."

To Jailbreak, plug in your PWNED device and press "Jailbreak Device." You'll know you have Jailbroken successfully if you see the message "Successfully booted device...installing Jailbreak." Let your device install the jailbreak, once your device has gone black you can put it back into PWNEDFU and boot it.

After your device has booted, you'll see the app "Jailbreak." Open it and tap "Jailbreak." This will install Cydia. When it is done installing Cydia, your device will reboot. One last time, put your device in PWNEDFU and boot it. You'll see Cydia. You are Jailbroken. (Note, on iOS 7 you might not immediately see Cydia, just wait 10-30 seconds.)
