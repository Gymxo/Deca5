# Deca5 v1.1 ‚òï

Tethered Downgrade Your A5 Device Today. By @zzanehip.

## What is Deca5?
* Deca5 (pronounced "Decaf") is a GUI tool to downgrade your A5 device. It is built with three things in mind: user-experience, performance, and reliability üëç.
* Deca5 is unique, it is built entierly using Swift, SwiftUI, and C ‚Äî it is built for modern versions of Mac OS. Moreover, much attention was given to the tool's design, look, and feel.
* And of course, Deca5 fully opensource üìÇ. Feel free to modify the tool to your liking. 
* Deca5 will run on any Mac running between El Capitan (**10.11**) and Big Sur (**11.0**) üñ•Ô∏è. It supports all **A5** (and theoretically all A6) devicesüì±.
* Users running **Catalina** or **Big Sur** can download Deca5. Users running between **El Capitan** and **Mojave** can download Deca5 (older Macs build). 
* To use Deca5 you must enter pwndfu (not kDFU) - this is possible thanks to @a1exdandy, @nyansatan, and @synackuk https://github.com/synackuk/checkm8-a5
* *Note, as of v1.1, Jailbreaking and Switchboard functionality has been temporarily removed due to various bugs. I'll restore the functionality in the next few days when all are fixed.*
* ***The latest release of Deca5 can be downloaded from [here.](https://github.com/zzanehip/Deca5/releases/latest)***
